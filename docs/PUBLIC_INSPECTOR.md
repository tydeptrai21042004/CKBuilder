# CKB Degree Proof v2.1 — Public Credential Inspector

## Purpose

The inspector is a reusable, read-only verifier. A verifier can check public credential evidence, optional document integrity, and live CKB Cell state without receiving the issuer's private key or controlling a wallet.

## Interfaces

### Credential inspection

```bash
npm run credential:inspect -- CKB-DEGREE-2026-0001 examples/certificate-original.pdf
```

Export a proof:

```bash
npm run credential:inspect -- CKB-DEGREE-2026-0001 examples/certificate-original.pdf --export=data/proof.json
```

### Raw Cell-data decoding

```bash
npm run cell:decode -- 0x...
npm run cell:decode -- data/revocations/example-active.bin
```

Optional expected values can be supplied through:

```bash
EXPECTED_CREDENTIAL_HASH=0x... EXPECTED_ISSUER_LOCK_HASH=0x... npm run cell:decode -- 0x...
```

### Exported-proof verification

```bash
npm run proof:verify -- data/proof.json
```

This recomputes the canonical digest, checks the schema and timestamp, and scans for obvious secret fields or absolute local paths.

## Browser and HTTP service

```bash
npm run inspector:serve
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:4173`.

| Endpoint | Operation |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/health` | service/network/format discovery |
| `POST /api/inspect` | credential and optional document inspection |
| `POST /api/decode-cell` | 75-byte raw Cell-data decoding |
| `POST /api/verify-proof` | exported-proof verification |

The server binds to localhost by default. Expose it publicly only behind deliberate deployment controls.

## Credential checks

- credential schema and ID binding;
- trusted issuer ID and CKB Lock Script hash;
- issuer Ed25519 signature;
- optional certificate SHA-256 hash;
- signed revocation-event credential and issuer binding;
- current live matching Cell through RPC;
- duplicate, conflicting, or malformed matching Cells;
- consistency between public credential and live Cell state;
- supplementary saved transaction lineage when available.

## Result states

| Outcome | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ACTIVE_VALID` | Public record, document, and live active Cell agree |
| `ACTIVE_DOCUMENT_NOT_CHECKED` | Active state agrees but no document was provided |
| `REVOKED` | Evidence is intact and state is revoked |
| `STATE_MISMATCH` | Off-chain and live on-chain states disagree |
| `CONFLICT_DUPLICATE` | Multiple live matching Cells exist |
| `INVALID_CHAIN_RECORD` | Matching Cell data violates the binary rules |
| `INVALID_EVIDENCE` | Signature, binding, schema, or revocation evidence is invalid |
| `ONCHAIN_RECORD_NOT_FOUND` | Public record exists but no live Cell was found |
| `OFFCHAIN_RECORD_NOT_FOUND` | Live Cell exists but public credential record is absent |
| `CHAIN_NOT_CHECKED` | RPC check was intentionally skipped |
| `RPC_UNAVAILABLE` | Live RPC could not be queried |
| `NOT_FOUND` | Neither public credential nor live Cell was found |

## Community reuse

The binary format and no-dependency decoder are published under `docs/CREDENTIAL_CELL_DATA_FORMAT.md` and `community/`. They can be tested without a signer or CKB node.

## Honest protocol boundary

The Type Script enforces issuer ownership and irreversible `ACTIVE → REVOKED` state for one lineage. It does not prevent another independent lineage from being created with the same credential hash. Duplicate live records are reported as a conflict rather than silently choosing one.
