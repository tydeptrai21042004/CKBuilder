- [ ] Record feedback and the resulting code/documentation change

## Handbook evidence

- [x] Prepare Week 1 and Week 2 evidence-linked reports
- [ ] Record exact CKB Academy modules and scores
- [ ] Record CCC Playground exercises with screenshots
- [ ] Explain Cell Model concepts in the participant's own words
- [ ] Distinguish OffCKB devnet from a synchronized CKB full node

Before publishing:

```bash
npm run ci:local
```

To reproduce the recorded deployment-tested contract version:

```bash
bash scripts/local-offckb-all.sh
```
